INTRODUCTION:

This is a collection of Python functions giving a semi-analytical solution to the problem of leakage between two connected aquifers.

The two aquifers are connected by a passive well (represented by a porous column and/or an open wellbore), and the solution accounts for the effect of the density difference between lifting and lifted brines during both upward and downward flow.
 
More info on this solution can be found online on the wiki, or in the article published in Transport in Porous Media 100 (2), 337-361.
